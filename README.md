  **Introduction**: Human norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis and food-borne illness in the United States. The wide variety of potential routes of exposure make estimates of transmissibility from outbreak data somewhat unreliable. In contrast, human challenge studies involve a controlled inoculation, where experimental settings and route of transmission can be controlled, among other factors. Our objective was to find all available norovirus challenge study data, and from these data, determine whether the infectivity of norovirus is consistent across human challenge studies.
  
  **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of the literature in order to find all studies which report using norovirus challenge data, and from these studies, we abstract data to obtain unique challenge cohort data.  From unique cohorts, we performed a meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals infected during each study, including subgroup analyses by study risk of bias, inoculum genogroup, and FUT2 participant genotype control, and *post hoc* outlier analyses to determine sources of heterogeneity. We additionally assessed the possibility of publication bias using a funnel plot.
  
  **Results**: We identified 65 reports for inclusion, and from those we found 20 studies which reported original collection of challenge data. We find a high degree of heterogeneity among studies, which is somewhat explained by outliers, and not explained by any abstracted covariates. Removing identified outliers reduces heterogeneity, but the outliers have no distinguishing features which set them apart from the other studies. The summary analyses are not meaningful due to the high degree of unexplainable heterogeneity.
  
  **Discussion**: Overall, we find that the attack rate of norovirus is not consistent across human challenge studies. Our results suggest that either the proportion of infected individuals in a norovirus challenge study is naturally heterogeneous, or is influenced primarily by unmeasured covariates. As potential infection rates may be dependent on several characteristics of research protocols, norovirus inoculum, research staff, and study participants, our results seem reasonable.
